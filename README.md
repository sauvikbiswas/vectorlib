vectorlib
=========

A Vector Operations Library

This is a (more or less) functional implementation of vector operations. Although it is written to accomodate nD vectors, it is best used for 3D operations. A number of operations have been defined so that they can be carried out using Python's native infix operators or built-in functions.
It is also numpy compatible - numpy 1D arrays can become vectors and vectors can be converted to numpy objects.
